:umbrella: Work in progress :umbrella:
----------------
This no longer matches the original stable version and is undergoing refactoring/rewriting.
You may still find the original version in cookiesdirective.com

Installation
================
```html
<script src="/path/to/cookiesdirective.js"></script>
<script>cookiesDirective.init();</script>
```

Configuration
================
`cookiesDirective.init()` can accept an object with the following parameters for configuration:

__Functionality/Positioning:__
* `domain` : Explicitly sets the cookie domain. E.g. host.com instead of yourcookieapp.host.com
* `repeatCount` : The number of times to display the banner before giving up. Defaults to 0 (never give up!).
* `position` : Where to place the banner ('top' or 'bottom'). Defaults to 'top'.
* `redirect` : Whether to redirect after accepting cookies or attempt to run js directly. Defaults to true.
* `displayTimeout` : The number of seconds to display the banner each time. Defaults to 9999.
* `cssPosition` : Either 'fixed' or 'absolute'. Defaults to 'fixed'

__Texts:__
* `policyUri` : The uri to point to for reading the policy. If not set no link will be printed.
* `thirdPartyApps` : Array of strings with the 3rd party apps that use cookies (for use by default texts)
* `disclosureHtml` : Overrides the default text (apart from the checkbox and button)
* `buttonLabel` : The text of the submit button
* `checkboxLabel` : The text next to the checkbox
* `agreementText` : The text reminding the user to tick the checkbox

*__Example:__*
```javascript
cookiesDirective.init({
    thirdPartyApps: ['Google Analytics', 'Share-this'],
    policyUri: '/policy.html',
    checkboxLabel: 'Coookieeees',
    displayTimeout: 10
});
```

Queueing for cookie acceptance
================
- An anonymous function
    ```javascript
    cookiesDirective.queue(function() {
        console.log('lambda');
    });
    ```

- An inline script
    ```html
    <script type="text/plain" class="cookie-directive-queue">
        console.log('test');
    </script>
    ```

- An external script
    ```html
    <script type="text/plain" class="cookie-directive-queue" src="http://hostname/example/file.js"></script>
    ```
    *Do not use this without redirection as many scripts depend on document-load events which might have already happened.*
